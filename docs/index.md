## Getting Started

Before making a new Sonolus.py engine or even reading through the rest of this documentation, it may be helpful to look 
at some examples to get a sense of how Sonolus.py is used.

The [pydori](https://github.com/qwewqa/pydori) engine is an example Sonolus.py engine that implements a Bandori-style
(vertical scrolling rhythm game) engine.

Once you're ready to start a new project, you may want to use the
[new project template](https://github.com/qwewqa/sonolus.py-template-project).
